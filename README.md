### Dev Notes

Hey Outdoosy team. 
I had a great time with this coding challenge. First time using tailwind and I love it. So easy to get something started. 

#### Things I'd do differently
I'd use a component library, just seemed wrong from something so small. 
I'm intrigued but unfamiliar Next.js but I felt it was unneccessary here. 

#### What's missing
Given more time, I would add a debounce to the search bar so it's not fetching the data on every key stroke. 
I DID add skeleton loaders, but the API responds back in 0.00001 secs for that was a bit of a waste. A loading icon would have been sufficient. 


Other then that, I enjoyed this. Roast me! 


Looking forward to speaking with y'all, 
Stephen Corona
